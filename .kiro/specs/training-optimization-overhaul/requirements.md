# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current MVFouls model training is experiencing severe performance issues including class imbalance problems, poor minority class recall (0% for most classes), high validation loss (12+), and potential architecture complexity issues. This feature aims to systematically optimize the training process to achieve balanced performance across all classes while maintaining model stability and generalization capability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Balanced Class Performance

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want the model to achieve reasonable recall (>20%) for all classes, so that the system can reliably detect all types of fouls and severity levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the model is trained THEN it SHALL achieve at least 45% macro recall for action classification
2. WHEN the model is trained THEN it SHALL achieve at least 45% macro recall for severity classification including Red Card
3. WHEN evaluating on validation set THEN each individual class SHALL achieve at least 25% recall
4. WHEN training completes THEN no class SHALL have 0% recall on validation set

### Requirement 2: Training Stability and Convergence

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want stable training with reasonable validation loss, so that the model can generalize well to unseen data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training progresses THEN validation loss SHALL decrease and stabilize below 5.0
2. WHEN using class rebalancing techniques THEN training SHALL remain stable without extreme loss spikes
3. WHEN training for extended periods THEN the model SHALL show continued improvement without early plateauing
4. WHEN applying regularization THEN overfitting SHALL be controlled while maintaining learning capacity

### Requirement 3: Architecture Optimization

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want to optimize the model architecture for the specific dataset characteristics, so that training is efficient and effective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using complex attention mechanisms THEN they SHALL contribute positively to performance metrics
2. WHEN comparing architecture variants THEN simpler alternatives SHALL be evaluated for baseline performance
3. WHEN training the model THEN the backbone SHALL be properly utilized without being over-constrained
4. WHEN implementing multi-task learning THEN task-specific components SHALL be appropriately balanced

### Requirement 4: Advanced Training Techniques

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want to implement proven training techniques for imbalanced datasets, so that minority classes are properly learned.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applying data augmentation THEN it SHALL improve minority class performance without degrading majority classes
2. WHEN using progressive training strategies THEN they SHALL accelerate convergence and improve final performance
3. WHEN implementing curriculum learning THEN the model SHALL learn from easy to hard examples effectively
4. WHEN using ensemble or pseudo-labeling techniques THEN they SHALL boost overall performance metrics

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Evaluation and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want detailed monitoring and evaluation capabilities, so that I can understand model behavior and make informed optimization decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training progresses THEN detailed per-class metrics SHALL be logged and visualized
2. WHEN evaluating model performance THEN confusion matrices and class-wise analysis SHALL be provided
3. WHEN comparing different approaches THEN systematic A/B testing framework SHALL be available
4. WHEN training completes THEN comprehensive performance reports SHALL be generated automatically
